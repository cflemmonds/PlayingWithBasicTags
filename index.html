    <h1>What sneakers did I wear on 12/15/2021?</h1>

    <p>Them ain't my legs but that was never the point, right?</p> <a href="https://sneakernews.com/2021/08/31/air-jordan-6-bordeaux-store-list-ct8529-063/" target=_blank>Oh, and here's a link to the kicks btw.</a>
    <!--I resized the image to fit within the heading above it. The original size was way too large. I even added a rounded border style to eliminate the hard edges.-->

    <p>I bet you're wondering, "What outfit did you wear?". The Bordeaux colorway is a tough one to pull off. Matching the color has a high barrier to entry; you are bound to struggle if your color matching skills aren't up to par. Is it maroon? Is it burgundy? Some will claim they see a deep red, others will say it's a weird shade of purple. Lucky for you, I've got a winning formula that will have you looking stylish while avoiding the pitfall of matching the exact shade.</p>

<ol>
    <h3>How to build an outfit</h3>
    <li>Start with the shoes. If the color is a tough match, find one that complements it. More on that later.</li>
    <li>Use that color and pick a top. Hoodie? Sure. Graphic tee? Knock yourself out. Polo? Oh you fancy, huh?</li>
    <li>Finally, find a nice pair of pants. Try not to overpower the color of the shoes and top with the pants.</li>
</ol>
    <p>And that will do it for today's quick fashion lesson. Catch you all next time. It's like 11:45pm and well beyond my bedtime.</p>
